# Alternative-UI / NEW Magic Lantern UI
This is the Official repository of the Alternative UI project which focuses on bringing a new and simple UI to Magic Lantern.

# Why?
What we found is that a lot of new users get scared away because of the current layout of Magic Lantern. Even seasoned ML users wish for a more simple UI. Lets be honest, it looks like a hack with many confusing options and a not so well arranged menu system. We want to change that into something that even a child can understand and something that looks more finished. This is why this project came to be and we feel like with the current shooting options that ML offers this is all it needs to have a Full Experience.

# UI Design
- The UI will be a much simpler version of the current builds with the Main Menu having six Icons/Buttons for an easy navigation as shown below. The final version does not have to be exactly like how its shown in these examples. Fonts for example can remain the same as in current builds and obviously if Power will be a limiting factor then all these icons can be low resolution.

- Every six of the main menu points will take the user to a submenu with the list of important settings. Just like the Main Menu this will also get a new look. Something thats easier on the eyes, looks simpler and better to navigate arround. Design example shown below.

- As you can see simplicity is the key here. Text and columns are bigger then in current builds for better visibility and no additional confusing text/options. Just important stuff remains: Option Name > Value > Toggle Switches. Easy to understand, nothing that could scare new users away.

# Changes to the Build
We think that Dannes latest build of Crop Mood is a perfect example towards what we are looking for in terms of the build. All the modules that are needed for a complete shooting experience will be enabled by default and anything else will be removed.
There is also a lot of stuff that the everyday user will never touch so all these options will be also removed so simplify things. We will make an update with a documentation about what we would like to keep and what can go, what options go where and why.
